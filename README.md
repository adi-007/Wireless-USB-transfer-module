# Wireless-USB-transfer-module

The basic idea of the project is to create a single battery powered WIFI module of the size of our fist which would transfer data from normal USB stick to any WIFI enabled device and act as a data sharing hub. This device can also be configured for sharing wireless Internet connection .
